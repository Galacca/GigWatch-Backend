Backend that uses GraphQL and Node

While there is some work to do the backend is mostly done.

Goal is to create a mobile app similiar to facebook events.
Not necessarily a super serious project, but I found the concept interesting enough to give it a go and I wanted to create an app
that I might actually consider using myself.

Features:

Add / Remove Friends, view gigs your friends are attending or interested in, mark a gig as attending or interested and switch or remove these statuses, rate a gig
